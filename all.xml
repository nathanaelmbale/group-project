				Romance! I am a Romance reader. I enjoy reading about the characters’ journey, from strangers to friends or enemies to lovers, falling in love, and the obstacles that they have to overcome. I can read anything that has some element of romance in it.
				
				One of my favourite sub-genres is Paranormal Romance. I would love to be a character that’s this badass female with terrifying power and saving the world (Kate Daniels’ series comes to my mind).
				
				I also enjoy Contemporary Romance, Mid-Darkish romance, Reverse Harem, Academy, and Bully Romance.

			<paragraph2>
				As you traverse the enchanting streets of Montmartre or take a leisurely boat ride along the Seine, each moment becomes a brushstroke in your own romantic masterpiece. Discover hidden cafes, share a kiss under the Eiffel Tower, and immerse yourself in the timeless allure of the City of Lights.
