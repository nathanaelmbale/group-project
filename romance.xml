        Romance! I am a Romance reader. I enjoy reading about the characters’ journey, from strangers to friends or enemies to lovers, falling in love, and the obstacles that they have to overcome. I can read anything that has some element of romance in it.

One of my favourite sub-genres is Paranormal Romance. I would love to be a character that’s this badass female with terrifying power and saving the world (Kate Daniels’ series comes to my mind).

I also enjoy Contemporary Romance, Mid-Darkish romance, Reverse Harem, Academy, and Bully Romance.
